			<h2>Consider Your Options</h2>
			<p>
				When you read a charged situation, <span class="important">roll+Clever</span>. On a hit, you can ask the DM
				questions. On a 10+, ask 3. On a
				7-9, ask 1:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Where's my best escape route / way in / way past?</li>
				<li>Which enemy is most vulnerable to me?</li>
				<li>Which enemy is the biggest threat?</li>
				<li>What should I be on the lookout for?</li>
				<li>What's my enemy's true position?</li>
				<li>Who's in control here?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On a miss, ask 1 anyway, but be prepared for the worst.</p>
			<p>The important word with this move is charged. Charged means there is tension. This tension could be who is
				going to attack first, or trying to navigate someone down from jumping. If you want to ask these questions
				normally you can and the DM will answer them to the best of your character's knowledge.</p>
			<p>Charged = tension = roll. Not charged = no tension = no roll.</p>
