		<h1>Basic Moves</h1>
		<div class="section">
			<h2 id="actUnderFire">Act Under Fire</h2>
			<p>
				When you do something under fire, or dig in to endure, roll+Sturdy. On a 10+, you do it. On a 7-9, you flinch,
				hesitate, or stall. The DM can offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice.
			</p>
			<p>On a miss, be prepared for the worst.</p>
			<p>This move can be literal, dodge gunfire, or more nebulous. Fire might be trying to sneak by and not be heard by
				the cultists. Fire might be to convince someone who has you at gunpoint not to shoot. While this can be
				physical, mental, or an emotional challenge it is represented by Sturdy, or how good are you at keeping your
				cool.
			</p>
			<p>
				On a 7-9 you still get what you want, but with a wrench tossed into your plans. Do not let the DM not give you
				your success.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Consider Your Options</h2>
			<p>
				When you read a charged situation, roll+Clever. On a hit, you can ask the DM questions. On a 10+, ask 3. On a
				7-9, ask 1:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Where's my best escape route / way in / way past?</li>
				<li>Which enemy is most vulnerable to me?</li>
				<li>Which enemy is the biggest threat?</li>
				<li>What should I be on the lookout for?</li>
				<li>What's my enemy's true position?</li>
				<li>Who's in control here?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On a miss, ask 1 anyway, but be prepared for the worst.</p>
			<p>The important word with this move is charged. Charged means there is tension. This tension could be who is
				going to attack first, or trying to navigate someone down from jumping. If you want to ask these questions
				normally you can and the DM will answer them to the best of your character's knowledge.</p>
			<p>Charged = tension = roll. Not charged = no tension = no roll.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Recall Your Studies</h2>
			<p>
				When you need to remember something important or obscure you study roll+Bookish. On a hit the DM tells you what
				you remember. On a 10+ you get something useful and interesting. On a 7-9 you get something interesting but not
				immediately useful.
			</p>
			<p>On a miss you open yourself to horrible truths or prepare for the worst.</p>
			<p>Pretty straight forward move, do you know anything about the subject? On a partial success 7-9 you will get
				interesting info related to the subject, but it may or may not be helpful. It'll be up to you to make it
				helpful.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Will Eldritch Power</h2>
			<p>
				When you try to bend the God's strength to your own roll+Occult. On a hit you succeed in what you wanted to do.
				On a 10+ choose one option below. On a 7-9 choose both options.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You take Mind damage equal to the intensity of your action. The DM can tell you this damage before you select
					this.
				</li>
				<li>A strange side effect occurs. It is never good.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On a miss, prepare for the worst.</p>
			<p>This move is related to working with and wielding the occult. While you get specific spells from your Affinity
				to the Old Gods this move helps you change reality through sheer force of will.</p>
			<p>
				This is a powerful move with terrible consequences even if you succeed. Not saying don't use it, but use it
				sparingly.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Convince</h2>
			<p>
				When you try to seduce, manipulate, bluff, fast-talk, or lie to someone, tell them what you want them to do,
				give them a reason, and roll+Persuasive. On a 10+, they'll go along with you, unless or until some fact or
				action betrays the reason you gave them. On a 7-9, they'll go along with you, but they need some concrete
				assurance, corroboration, or evidence first.
			</p>
			<p>On a miss, be prepared for the worst.</p>
			<p>Only note is that this is not Mind Control. The character has to be willing to see your side of things.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Read a person</h2>
			<p>
				When you read a person in a charged situation, roll+Persuasive. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. While you're
				interacting with them, spend your hold to ask the character questions, 1 for 1:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is the character telling the truth?</li>
				<li>What's the character really feeling?</li>
				<li>What does the character intend to do?</li>
				<li>What does the character wish I'd do?</li>
				<li>How could I get the character to â€”?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On a miss, ask 1 anyway, but be prepared for the worst.</p>
			<p>Main note is you don't ask all of these questions immediately unlike Consider Your Options. You can hold onto
				your questions until it's advantageous to use them.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Help/Hinder</h2>
			<p>
				When you help or interfere with someone who's making a roll, roll+Connection. On a 10+, they take +2 (help) or
				-2 (interfere) to their roll. On a 7-9, they take +1 (help) or -1 (interfere) to their roll.
			</p>
			<p>
				On a miss, be prepared for the worst.
			</p>
			<p>Does not apply to Downtime moves. This uses your character's Connection in relation to the other character. If
				somebody helps/hinders they need to describe how they do it. Not, "I'm helping I'm a helper," instead, "I
				provide a distraction so the Mercenary can sneak behind the guard." Multiple people can help, but only the
				highest or lowest help/hinder counts. Everyone who is helping/hindering suffers some of the consequences that
				the player making the move does.</p>
