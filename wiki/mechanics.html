			<h2>Out of Combat</h2>
			<p>
				You will go about playing the RPG as normal, declaring your actions and having the DM respond. If there is a
				decision point where a roll matters, or when the player wishes to, perform a Move. These Moves have specific
				names
				and specific outcomes. Moves always have <span class="important">2d6+stat</span>, and always follow this chart:
			<ul>
				<li>
					2-6 - Fail. Sometimes you get partially what you want, but at a great cost. Prepare for the worst.
				</li>
				<li>
					7-9 - Partial success. You succeed, but it is not as much as you want to succeed or there are hidden
					complications.
				</li>
				<li>10+ Success. You get what you want. Good job.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Pressure</h2>
			<p>
				When exploring dangerous areas the Pressure deck comes into play. The deck consists of 21 cards, 18 number cards
				and 3 face cards. Shuffle them all together.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every move into an unknown location, searching for loot, or other situations that take time the party must make
				a
				pressure roll. A player chooses a stat. Then <span class="important">roll+stat</span>.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2-6 - Flip over two cards.</li>
				<li>7-9 - Flip over one card.</li>
				<li>10+ - Flip over zero cards</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If a face card is drawn <span class="important">something bad happens</span>. After that's been resolved the
				pressure deck is recreated with 14 cards, 12 number cards and 2 face cards. Repeat the process and build again
				with 7 cards, 6 number cards and 1 face card. After that repeat the 7 card setup while replacing 1 number card
				with 1 face card.
			</p>
			<p>When the party goes into downtime the pressure deck is reset.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Downtime</h2>
			<p>
				When the party is in a safe place to rest they can enter <span class="important">Downtime</span>. This is the
				equivalent of resting/sleeping/working on something in your spare time. Usually about 4-8 hours. During Downtime
				you gain points to spend on Downtime moves. Much like normal moves there is a basic list, and additional moves
				you
				can learn from other sources.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Combat</h2>
			<p>When people want other people dead we enter combat.</p>
			<p>
				Before Combat starts everyone will need to make a <span class="important">Fear Roll</span>. This roll determines
				how much Mind damage you will take. The DM will declare the horror of the monster (none to Terror) and
				characters
				will <span class="important">roll+Sturdy</span>. Depending on your roll and the horror of the monster you will
				suffer Mind damage.</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Roll</th>
					<th>10+</th>
					<th>7-9</th>
					<th>6-</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>None</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>0</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Scary</td>
					<td>0</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>5</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Fear</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>5</td>
					<td>10</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Terror</td>
					<td>5</td>
					<td>10</td>
					<td>20</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				During combat the only die you will be using is the Death Die, also known as a d20.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Initiative</h2>
			<p>
				To determine initiative all participants in combat roll a d20. From highest to lowest record if the number
				rolled
				is
				a player or monster. Players win ties. If a combat with 3 players and 2 enemies it might looks something like
				this:
				P, M, P, P, M
			</p>
			<p>
				Starting with the first in turn order that initiative slot can be used by anyone on the side it represents. For
				example, if that initiative slot is a player's then <span class="important">any</span> player can take their
				turn.
				Once their turn is complete, then they can no longer act in combat. If the initiative slot is an enemy the same
				applies. If the character wishes they can move their initiative slot to later in the turn order. At the end of
				the
				round everyone still fighting rolls again to determine a new initiative order.
			</p>
			<p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>Example: The Knight and Mercenary are confronted by two guards. These men have been corrupted by dark magic
					as
					they are 1 Â½ times the size of an average man. From their guttural calls for blood and killing this can only
					end
					with a fight. Everyone rolls for initiative. The Knight rolls a 15, the Mercenary rolls 10, the first Guard
					rolls
					a 12, and the second Guard rolls a 4. The turn order is:</p>
				<p>Player, Enemy, Player, Enemy.</p>
				<p>
					"I'll go first," says the Mercenary, "with your stunning mace you can stun the enemy who didn't attack, or try
					to
					kill the guard I attack if I deal enough damage."
				</p>
				<p>"Sounds good." replies the Knight. The Mercenary takes the first turn in the initiative and attacks Guard no.
					1.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Face Cards</h2>
			<p>
				When using a face card in the initiative order there are bonus effects for both the players and enemies.
			<ul>
				Players:
				<li>
					Hearts/Diamonds J,Q,K - +1 to your next roll.
				</li>
				<li>
					Hearts Ace - Take another action at the end of the round. It cannot be the same action you have used this
					turn.
				</li>
				<li>
					Diamond Ace - Gain an equal about of Rev Tokens spent this turn.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Enemies:
				<li>
					Any face card - Trigger a special ability.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Moving</h2>
			<p>
				The map drawn will be divided into zones. If you are in a zone with a monster or player then you can interact
				with
				them. Each turn you can move 1 zone and still take an action. You can action then move or move then action. You
				can move an additional zone as your action allowing you to move 2 zones in a turn.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Melee Attacks</h2>
			<p>
				When you wish to attack, determine where you are and where the enemy is. If you are in the same zone then you
				can
				make a melee attack. If you wish to attack in a different zone the attack you are using will need to have the
				Ranged tag.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next choose your target. Every attack you make is an aimed shot, the only difference is if you attack the head
				you
				will lower the intensity of your attack by one. Tactical choices are important as disabling an important limb or
				destroying their body might lead to a quick victory.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next determine the length of each weapon being used (unarmed, short, medium, long). Whoever had the longer
				range<span class="superImportant">may</span> choose to <span class="important">first strike</span>. First strike
				lets you attack first using the next initiative slot in order. If you inflict major damage to the attacker with
				a
				first strike the following attack will have -1 intensity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Attack: Roll Death Dice (d20). Take that number rolled and add or subtract any bonuses (+1, -2, etc) then
				increase
				or decrease the intensity of the attack as needed. Always add/subtract bonuses first, and then increase/decrease
				intensity. Finally check to see how much damage you have done.
			</p>
			<ul>
				Death Dice Results:
				<li>1-5: Miss.</li>
				<li>6-10: Minor damage.</li>
				<li>11-15 Major damage.</li>
				<li>16-19 Critical damage.</li>
				<li>20 Kill. <span class="superImportant">The same applies to the enemies.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				A 20 can always be lowered in intensity, but a 1 is always a miss.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>
					Example: The Outlander charges at the enemy Yellow Mage, Two-Handed Ax in hand. The Yellow Mage is wielding a
					sacrificial dagger with range short, so the Yellow Mage cannot first strike against the Outlander's Long
					ranged
					ax. The Outlander is targeting the Yellow Mage's right arm to disrupt whatever spellcasting he is planning on
					doing. The Outlander rolls the d20. 10! A minor wound. The Outlander has the ability Melee Proficiency
					increasing their roll by +1. 11! A major wound. The Two-Handed Ax has the Deadly tag increasing the intensity
					of
					the attack by 1. The major wound turns into a Critical Wound.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Outlander chops into the enemy Yellow Mage dealing massive damage. The
					Yellow Mage screams in pain as his right arm is cut off completely. The
					Yellow Mage is just barely still alive and is preparing an attack with his
					dagger for his next action. With the initiative order the heroes are up
					next.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Ranged Attacks</h2>
			<p>
				When making a ranged attack you need an attack with the Ranged tag and for there to be an enemy one space away.
				<span class="superImportant">You cannot make a ranged attack if you have been attacked in melee range during
					this
					round</span>. If all of these conditions are met, fire away. Use the same attack rules as a melee attack minus
				the first strike section.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>Example: The Outland and Mercenary are trying to get the drop off some guards but they
					were noticed. The first guard moves into the zone with the two characters and attacks the Outland with his
					meat
					cleaver. Next it's the players turn. "I want to move back a zone and fire my bow at the guard who attacked
					me,"
					the Outlander declared.
				<p>
					"Sorry, you can move but because the guard attacked you with his melee weapon you cannot make a ranged attack
					this round. You can still move back if you want."
				</p>
				<p>
					"I will attack him with my ax and then move back a zone. Mercenary, can you guard me until the next round?"
				</p>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Armor/Block</h2>
			<p>
				When a player or monster is attacked they can use one charge of their armor to negate that damage. Armor covers
				the whole body unless otherwise stated, so armor can be used on any damage roll. Armor does not repair itself on
				its own, so it is a limited resource.
			</p>
			<p>
				Physical Block can block physical attacks.
			</p>
			<p>
				Magic Block can block magical attacks.
			</p>

			<div class="example">
				<p>
					Example: The Mercenary is being flanked by two guards. One guard attacks dealing minor damage to his body, the
					next guard is up and brings his cleaver down onto him with great force. 19!
				</p>
				<p>
					"Shit," says the mercenary player. If he does nothing this attack will critically wound him. "Good thing I'm
					wearing Leather Armor!" This isn't the first time they used their armor, so they mark their armor block from 1
					out of 2 to 0 out of 2. "Still not in a good spot, but at least I'm not going to immediately die. Hey Knight,
					want to help me out?"
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Guarding</h2>
			<p>
				If you wish on your turn you can guard, sacrificing your turn. While
				guarding if someone is attacked while in your zone you can take the attack
				instead. You must declare you are guarding the attack before dice are
				rolled. Certain items and skills help lower the damage taken from guarded
				hits, but by default you take full damage. You can only defend against one
				enemy attack when guarding.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>
					Example: The Knight realizes that the Mercenary is wounded and out of block. Luckily the Mercenary killed one
					of
					the Monsters so it is 2 on 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					"While I know the enemy is wounded I don't want to risk anything." The Knight looks towards the Mercenary,
					"Stand next to me and I'll be your shield."
				</p>
				<p>
					The knight guards on her turn. As the monster attacks the Knight steps in the way. 11! Major damage.
				</p>
				<p>
					"With my kite shield Defensive tag I lower the intensity of the attack by 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					The major damage turns into minor damage as the Knight deflects the monster's cleaver to the side.
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				Rev Tokens - In battle each player character start
				with 1 Rev Token. These tokens represent your willpower to not die. You
				can use a Rev Token anytime to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Reroll your dice
				</li>
				<li>
					Reroll the enemy dice
				</li>
				<li>
					Use them for some spell costs.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When you take critical damage for the first
				time in combat you gain 1 Rev Token.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>
					Example: The Dark Priest is wanting to throw a poison dart at a Lord of Flies. Getting the poison to spread
					through the large beast's body early will swing the fight in their favor. They throw the dart. 3!
				</p>
				<p>
					"Drat." The Dark Priest thinks to themselves, "I want to use a Rev Token to reroll this, but at the same time
					I need it to absorb the Mind cost of my Hurting spell."
				</p>
				<p>
					"Just reroll it." The Outlander says, "Hurting is only 30 Mind. The poison will really help us."
				</p>
				<p>
					The Dark Priest sighs, "Fine. I'm using my Rev Token to reroll my dice."
				</p>
			</div>
			<p>
				<span class="important">Other Combat Rules:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="important">Spill Over</span> - If you hit a location that is critical roll the d6 again and
				increase intensity by 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="important">Headshots</span> - You can do a headshot with either ranged or melee attacks. Reduce
				intensity of the attack by 1
				unless your attack has the Precise tag.
