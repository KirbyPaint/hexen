		<h1>Character Sheet</h1>
		<div class="section">
			<p><span class="important">Name:</span> The name of those who will suffer.</p>
			<p><span class="important">Soul:</span> The soul given to the character at birth. Roleplaying only.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="important">Profession:</span> General description of what they did before the terrible events to
				follow.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="important">Phobia:</span> What they are truly scared of. You will incur minuses when
				interacting/fighting these creatures.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<p><span class="important">Body:</span> Health and Stamina</p>
			<p>Your body is divided into six parts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Head</li>
				<li>Body</li>
				<li>Left Arm</li>
				<li>Right Arm</li>
				<li>Left Leg</li>
				<li>Right Leg</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Each limb and the head can take 4 ticks of damage. The body can take 6 ticks of damage. Minor damage is one box,
				major damage is two boxes, and critical is 4 boxes. You cannot go past the max number of boxes. No overkill.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have two critical wounds on your limbs (four boxes ticked on one limb) or one critical wound on your head
				or body, <span class="important">then your character dies</span>.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<p>Minor wound - scratches, scuffs, black eye. Will heal on its own.</p>
			<p>Major wound - part is hurt. Still usable but requires medical attention.</p>
			<p>Critical wound - part is unusable. Major medical attention is needed or the character will die.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<p><span class="important">Mind:</span> Sanity and spell resources.</p>
			<p>
				Your mind is your current mental state on how you are dealing with the horrors of the world. This will go down
				with Fear rolls. Most spells also take Mind to use.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Sane - 100-51</li>
				<li>Afraid - 50-26</li>
				<li>Panicked - 25-1</li>
				<li>Psychotic break - 0 (Not good)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				If you are at 0 Mind and take mental damage, flip a coin and call a side. If you are right you take 1 critical
				damage to one of your limbs. If you are wrong your character dies.
			</p>
			<p>You can regain Mind when you rest. There are other ways to restore it, but they are not pretty...</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
