	<h1>Mechanics</h1>
	<h2>Out of Combat</h2>
	<p>You will go about playing the RPG as normal, declaring your actions and having the DM respond. If there is a decision
	point where a roll matters, or when the player wishes to, perform a Move. These Moves have specific names and specific
	outcomes. Moves always have 2d6+stat, and always follow this chart:
	
	2-6 - Fail. Sometimes you get partially what you want, but at a great cost. Prepare for the worst.
	7-9 - Partial success. You succeed, but it is not as much as you want to succeed or there are hidden complications.
	10+ Success. You get what you want. Good job.</p>

	<h2>Pressure</h2>
	<p>
		When exploring dangerous areas the Pressure deck comes into play. The deck consists of 21 cards, 18 number cards and 3
		face cards. Shuffle them all together.
		
		Every move into an unknown location, searching for loot, or other situations that take time the party must make a
		pressure roll. A player chooses a stat. Then roll+stat.
		
		2-6 - Flip over two cards.
		7-9 - Flip over one card.
		10+ - Flip over zero cards
		
		If a face card is drawn something bad happens. After that's been resolved the pressure deck is recreated with 14 cards,
		12 number cards and 2 face cards. Repeat the process and build again with 7 cards, 6 number cards and 1 face card. After
		that repeat the 7 card setup while replacing 1 number card with 1 face card.
		
		When the party goes into downtime the pressure deck is reset.
	</p>
	<h2>Downtime</h2>
	<p>When the party is in a safe place to rest they can enter Downtime. This is the equivalent of both
	resting/sleeping/working on something in your spare time. Usually about 4-8 hours. During Downtime you gain points to
	spend on Downtime moves. Much like normal moves there is a basic list, and additional moves you can from other sources.</p>
	<h2>Combat</h2>
	<p>When people want other people dead we enter combat.
	
	Before Combat starts everyone will need to make a Fear Roll. This roll determines how much Mind damage you will take.
	The DM will declare the horror of the monster (none to Terror) and characters will roll+Sturdy. Depending on your roll
	and the horror of the monster you will suffer Mind damage.
	
	Roll 10+, 7-9, 6-
	None - 0, 0, 0
	Scary - 0, 2, 5
	Fear - 2, 5, 10
	Terror - 5, 10, 20
	
	During combat the only dice you will be using is the Death Dice, also known as a d20.</p>
	<h2>Initiative</h2>
	<p>
		To determine initiative all participants in combat roll a d20. From highest to lowest record if the number rolled is a
		player or monster.players win ties. If a combat with 3 players and 2 enemies it might looks something like this:
		P, M, P, P, M
		
		Starting with the first in turn order that initiative slot can be used by anyone on the side it represents. For example, if
		that initiative slot is a players then any player can take their turn. Once their turn is complete, then they can no
		longer act in combat. If the initiative slot is an enemy the same applies. If the character wishes they can move their
		initiative slot to later in the turn order. At the end of the round everyone still fighting rolls again to determine a
		new initiative order.
		
		Example: The Knight and Mercenary are confronted by two guards. These men have been corrupted by dark magic as they are
		1 ½ times the size of an average man. From their guttural calls for blood and killing this can only end with a fight.
		Everyone rolls for initiative. The Knight rolls a 15, the Mercenary rolls 10, the first Guard rolls a 12, and the second
		Guard rolls a 4. The turn order is:
		Player, Enemy, Player, Enemy.
		
		“I'll go first,” says the Mercenary, “with your stunning mace you can stun the enemy who didn't attack, or try to kill
		the guard I attack if I deal enough damage.”
		“Sounds good.” replies the Knight. The Mercenary takes the first turn in the initiative and attacks Guard no. 1.
	</p>
	<h2>Face Cards</h2>
	<p>When using a face card in the initiative order there are bonus effects for both the players and enemies.
	
	Players:
	Hearts/Diamonds J,Q,K - +1 to your next roll.
	Hearts Ace - Take another action at the end of the round. It cannot be the same action you have used thus turn.
	Diamond Ace - Gain an equal about of Rev Tokens spent this turn.
	
	Enemies:
	Any face card - Trigger a special ability.</p>
	<h2>Moving</h2>
	<p>The map drawn will be divided into zones. If you are in a zone with a monster or player then you can interact with them.
	Each turn you can move 1 zone and still take an action. You action then move or move then action. You can move an
	additional zone as your action allowing you to move 2 zones in a turn.</p>

	<h2>Melee Attacks</h2>
	<p>
		When you wish to attack, determine where you are and where the enemy is. If you are in the same zone then you can make a
		melee attack. If you wish to attack in a different zone the attack you are using will need to have the Ranged tag.
		Next choose your target. Every attack you make is an aimed shot, the only difference is if you attack the head you will
		lower the intensity of your attack by one. Tactical choices are important as disabling an important limb or destroying
		their body might lead to a quick victory.
		Next determine the length of each weapon being used (unarmed, short, medium, long). Whoever had the longer range may
		choose to first strike. First strike lets you attack first using the next initiative slot in order. If you inflict major
		damage to the attacker with a first strike the following attack will have -1 intensity.
		
		Attack: Roll Death Dice (d20). Take that number rolled and add or subtract any bonuses (+1, -2, etc) then increase or
		decrease the intensity of the attack as needed. Always add/subtract bonuses first, and then increase/decrease intensity.
		Finally check to see how much damage you have done.
		
		Death Dice Results:
		1-5: Miss.
		6-10: Minor damage.
		11-15 Major damage.
		16-19 Critical damage.
		20 Kill. The same applies to the enemies.
		
		A 20 can always be lowered in intensity, but a 1 it's always a miss.
		
		Example: The Outlander charges at the enemy Yellow Mage, Two-Handed Ax in hand. The Yellow Mage is wielding a
		sacrificial dagger with range short, so the Yellow Mage cannot first strike against the Outlander’s Long ranged ax. The
		Outlander is targeting the Yellow Mage’s right arm to disrupt whatever spellcasting he is planning on doing. The
		Outlander rolls the d20. 10! A minor wound. The Outlander has the ability Melee Proficiency increasing their roll by +1.
		11! A major wound. The Two-Handed Ax has the Deadly tag increasing the intensity of the attack by 1. The major wound
		turns into a Critical Wound.
		The Outlander chops into the enemy Yellow mage dealing massive damage. The yellow mage screams in pain as his right arm
		is cut off completely. The Yellow Mage is just barely still alive and is preparing an attack with his dagger for his
		next action. With the initiative order the heroes are up next.
