	<h1>Mechanics</h1>
	<h2>Out of Combat</h2>
	<p>You will go about playing the RPG as normal, declaring your actions and having the DM respond. If there is a decision
	point where a roll matters, or when the player wishes to, perform a Move. These Moves have specific names and specific
	outcomes. Moves always have 2d6+stat, and always follow this chart:
	
	2-6 - Fail. Sometimes you get partially what you want, but at a great cost. Prepare for the worst.
	7-9 - Partial success. You succeed, but it is not as much as you want to succeed or there are hidden complications.
	10+ Success. You get what you want. Good job.</p>

	<h2>Pressure</h2>
	<p>
		When exploring dangerous areas the Pressure deck comes into play. The deck consists of 21 cards, 18 number cards and 3
		face cards. Shuffle them all together.
		
		Every move into an unknown location, searching for loot, or other situations that take time the party must make a
		pressure roll. A player chooses a stat. Then roll+stat.
		
		2-6 - Flip over two cards.
		7-9 - Flip over one card.
		10+ - Flip over zero cards
		
		If a face card is drawn something bad happens. After that's been resolved the pressure deck is recreated with 14 cards,
		12 number cards and 2 face cards. Repeat the process and build again with 7 cards, 6 number cards and 1 face card. After
		that repeat the 7 card setup while replacing 1 number card with 1 face card.
		
		When the party goes into downtime the pressure deck is reset.
	</p>
	<h2>Downtime</h2>
	<p>When the party is in a safe place to rest they can enter Downtime. This is the equivalent of both
	resting/sleeping/working on something in your spare time. Usually about 4-8 hours. During Downtime you gain points to
	spend on Downtime moves. Much like normal moves there is a basic list, and additional moves you can from other sources.</p>
